# Gnome MarkDown Editor

My vision of what I believe would be the best approach to a GTK3 markdown editor, following the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines.

As GNOME provides already a text editor (not MD), it's based on Gedit, adding more functionality for rich text documents.

I got some inspiration from the great programs [Abricotine](http://abricotine.brrd.fr) and [Typora](https://typora.io). I consider distracting and a waste of space the "two windows" editors. 

Main view with toolbar and panel:

Showing code view (without the tool bar):

Even when shows code the style of the document persists.

## Todo

- Preferences Window
  - Modify CSS and add more styles 
  - Font type and size
  - Dark Theme option
  - Tabulation width
  - Autocompletion
  - Autosave
  - Import and export options
  - And others ...
  
I'll look into it for the next update :)
